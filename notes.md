- Mesh
- Variables:
    - Mesh variables
        - express these as "variable packs", e.g. MHD, Euler, MHD+Euler, etc.
        - components
    - non-mesh variables
        - components
- Timestepping scheme:
    - RK<whatever>
        - DG operator
            - The DG operator knows exactly which variables are in which components
            - boundary conditions
            - Including diffusive terms, which we resolve ``inline''.
            - optional terms such as resistivity should be turned on or off based
              on whether a coefficient vanishes (we'll skip computations if possible).
