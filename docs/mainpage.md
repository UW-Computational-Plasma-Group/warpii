# WarpII Documentation {#mainpage}

Welcome to the user documentation for the WarpII project.
All of WarpII's documentation is intended to fit into one of [four categories](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/):
- [Tutorials](#getting_started): lessons that take the reader through a series of steps to complete a small project.
These are useful for starting out.
- [How-to guides](#howto): these are guides for the user who knows what they want to accomplish
and is already familiar with the main concepts involved. They should be useful for day-to-day usage of WarpII.
- [Reference material](#reference): technical descriptions of the options and APIs exposed by WarpII.
- [Explanatory guides](usergroup0.html): articles that clarify a topic. They are for improving
understanding rather than helping the user achieve any particular task.
