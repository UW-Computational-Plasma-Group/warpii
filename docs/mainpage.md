# WarpII Documentation {#mainpage}

Welcome to the user documentation for the WarpII project.
Plasma simulation software is necessarily quite complex, and documentation is the only
way to manage that complexity.
All of WarpII's documentation is intended to fit into one of [four categories](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/):
- [Tutorials](#getting_started): lessons that take the reader through a series of steps to complete a small project.
These are useful for starting out.
- [How-to guides](#howto): these are guides for the user who knows what they want to accomplish
and is already familiar with the main concepts involved. They should be useful for day-to-day usage of WarpII.
- [Reference material](#reference): 
- [Explanatory guides](#explanation)
